For the second consecutive year, I attended the Asilomar conference on signals, systems, and computers (2023 & 2024).

This year, I had a lecture presentation of my work on consensus-ADMM optimization for beamforming in cell-free systems.\
It was a pleasure reconnecting with Dr. César A. Uribe, and I’m excited about the potential for future collaborations.
I would also like to acknowledge the invaluable support from my current advisor, Prof. Lee Swindlehurst, whose guidance has helped me build and maintain connections with colleagues and collaborators in the field.
