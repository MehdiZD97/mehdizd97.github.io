Last week, we attended the POWDER-RENEW Mobile and Wireless Week (MWW) 2023 at the University of Utah.

It was a great opportunity to learn more about the capabilities of the POWDER platform, a powerful infrastructure enabling a wide range of software-defined experiments on future wireless networks.
It was also an excellent chance to interact with many researchers and experts in the hashtag#wireless area.
Finally, we won the first prize for our project during MWW, and we hope to narrow it down to a more innovative research work.
I want to extend my appreciation to the diligent POWDER-RENEW experts and staff, especially professor Kobus van der Merwe, for all the help and support during this week.
