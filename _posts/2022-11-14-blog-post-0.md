A measurement campaign of multi-user MIMO channel sounding and beamforming using RENEW platform at Rice University.

I was collecting extensive datasets for the experimental phase of my current project: "Evaluating Distributed MU-MIMO Beamforming." We used [RENEW](https://lnkd.in/gg-QWuZ9) programmable massive MIMO platform, including 4 radio heads each one with a linear array of 16 antennas connected to a central hub as our Access Points (AP), and 6 standalone Iris SDRs as our clients (UE).
We collected uplink (pilot + data) datasets in multiple scenarios:
- Centralized: co-located APs with coherent / non-coherent array
- Distributed: distributed APs with coherent / non-coherent array

We made these datasets publicly available for research purposes.
In our previous work that was published in IEEE SAM 2022, we generated extensive datasets that are available too.
