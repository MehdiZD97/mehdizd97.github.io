For the third consecutive year, I attended the Asilomar conference in Pacific Grove.

This year, my paper "**Coordinated Decentralized Resource Optimization for Cell-Free ISAC Systems**" was shortlisted for the Best Paper Award contest.
I had a poster presentation at the Student Paper Contest (SPC) and a lecture presentation at the conference.\
It was a pleasure having my advisor, **_Prof. Lee Swindlehurst_**, attend my lecture and support my presentation.
