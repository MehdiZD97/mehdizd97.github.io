Two short tutorial videos of mine has been posted on YouTube.

In these accessible guides, I cover antenna parameters and linear array model. 

- [Watch Antenna Parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO37pcl0t7A): I provide brief definitions of some key parameters of antennas, from radiation pattern to radiation efficiency, VSWR, directivity, and gain.
- [Watch Linear Array Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-IcUX1w1Z0&t=42s): I provide the definitions and details of linear array response and beamforming gain.
