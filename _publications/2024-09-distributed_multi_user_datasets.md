We conducted a massive MIMO channel measurement and uplink multi-user data transmission experiment in an indoor setting on the Rice University campus.
The original purpose of this dataset was to study the effect of placement of massive MIMO BS arrays on performance in two scenarios of co-located and separated (distributed) as well as the effect of phase coherence among the arrays during channel measurement and data transmission.
